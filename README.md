# Asteroid Hello World
A hello world app for [AsteroidOS](http://asteroidos.org/)

This is just [asteroid-stopwatch](https://github.com/AsteroidOS/asteroid-stopwatch) but with a bunch of stuff removed, and
with a different name so that you can play with it without overwriting the stopwatch app.

## Dependencies
